
# SDCND : Sensor Fusion and Tracking
This is the project for the second course in the  [Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213) : Sensor Fusion and Tracking. 

In this project, you'll fuse measurements from LiDAR and camera and track vehicles over time. You will be using real-world data from the Waymo Open Dataset, detect objects in 3D point clouds and apply an extended Kalman filter for sensor fusion and tracking.

The project consists of two major parts: 
1. **Object detection**: In this part, a deep-learning approach is used to detect vehicles in LiDAR data based on a birds-eye view perspective of the 3D point-cloud. Also, a series of performance measures is used to evaluate the performance of the detection approach. 
2. **Object tracking** : In this part, an extended Kalman filter is used to track vehicles over time, based on the lidar detections fused with camera detections. Data association and track management are implemented as well.

The following diagram contains an outline of the data flow and of the individual steps that make up the algorithm.

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt` 

### Waymo Open Dataset Reader
The Waymo Open Dataset Reader is a very convenient toolbox that allows you to access sequences from the Waymo Open Dataset without the need of installing all of the heavy-weight dependencies that come along with the official toolbox. The installation instructions can be found in `tools/waymo_reader/README.md`. 

### Waymo Open Dataset Files
This project makes use of three different sequences to illustrate the concepts of object detection and tracking. These are: 
- Sequence 1 : `training_segment-1005081002024129653_5313_150_5333_150_with_camera_labels.tfrecord`
- Sequence 2 : `training_segment-10072231702153043603_5725_000_5745_000_with_camera_labels.tfrecord`
- Sequence 3 : `training_segment-10963653239323173269_1924_000_1944_000_with_camera_labels.tfrecord`

To download these files, you will have to register with Waymo Open Dataset first: [Open Dataset – Waymo](https://waymo.com/open/terms), if you have not already, making sure to note "Udacity" as your institution.

Once you have done so, please [click here](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/waymo_open_dataset_v_1_2_0_individual_files) to access the Google Cloud Container that holds all the sequences. Once you have been cleared for access by Waymo (which might take up to 48 hours), you can download the individual sequences. 

The sequences listed above can be found in the folder "training". Please download them and put the `tfrecord`-files into the `dataset` folder of this project.


### Pre-Trained Models
The object detection methods used in this project use pre-trained models which have been provided by the original authors. They can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Pqx7sShlqKSGmvshTYbNDcUEYyZwfn3A/view?usp=sharing) (darknet) and [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RcEfUIF1pzDZco8PJkZ10OL-wLL2usEj/view?usp=sharing) (fpn_resnet). Once downloaded, please copy the model files into the paths `/tools/objdet_models/darknet/pretrained` and `/tools/objdet_models/fpn_resnet/pretrained` respectively.

### Using Pre-Computed Results

In the main file `loop_over_dataset.py`, you can choose which steps of the algorithm should be executed. If you want to call a specific function, you simply need to add the corresponding string literal to one of the following lists: 

- `exec_data` : controls the execution of steps related to sensor data. 
  - `pcl_from_rangeimage` transforms the Waymo Open Data range image into a 3D point-cloud
  - `load_image` returns the image of the front camera

- `exec_detection` : controls which steps of model-based 3D object detection are performed
  - `bev_from_pcl` transforms the point-cloud into a fixed-size birds-eye view perspective
  - `detect_objects` executes the actual detection and returns a set of objects (only vehicles) 
  - `validate_object_labels` decides which ground-truth labels should be considered (e.g. based on difficulty or visibility)
  - `measure_detection_performance` contains methods to evaluate detection performance for a single frame

In case you do not include a specific step into the list, pre-computed binary files will be loaded instead. This enables you to run the algorithm and look at the results even without having implemented anything yet. The pre-computed results for the mid-term project need to be loaded using [this](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-s46dKSrtx8rrNwnObGbly2nO3i4D7r7?usp=sharing) link. Please use the folder `darknet` first. Unzip the file within and put its content into the folder `results`.

- `exec_tracking` : controls the execution of the object tracking algorithm

- `exec_visualization` : controls the visualization of results
  - `show_range_image` displays two LiDAR range image channels (range and intensity)
  - `show_labels_in_image` projects ground-truth boxes into the front camera image
  - `show_objects_and_labels_in_bev` projects detected objects and label boxes into the birds-eye view
  - `show_objects_in_bev_labels_in_camera` displays a stacked view with labels inside the camera image on top and the birds-eye view with detected objects on the bottom
  - `show_tracks` displays the tracking results
  - `show_detection_performance` displays the performance evaluation based on all detected 
  - `make_tracking_movie` renders an output movie of the object tracking results

Even without solving any of the tasks, the project code can be executed. 

The final project uses pre-computed lidar detections in order for all students to have the same input data. If you use the workspace, the data is prepared there already. Otherwise, [download the pre-computed lidar detections](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IkqFGYTF6Fh_d8J3UjQOSNJ2V42UDZpO?usp=sharing) (~1 GB), unzip them and put them in the folder `results`.

Final Project: Sensor Fusion and Object Tracking

I have attached my code in the submitted file with this zip folders including loop_over_dataset.py

Please find the attached pictures below for the Step 1-4 of the project and RMSE values at each step.

Step 1: Tracking

Within the "filter.py" file, the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is put into use.
To start, we establish the system states as [x, y, z, vx, vy, vz], construct the process model, and specify the constant velocity model. Following this, we proceed to deduce the system matrix for the 3D process models, considering the presence of constant velocity and noise covariances. This phase is pivotal for the computation of both the state function denoted as h(x) and the Jacobian matrix referred to as H.
To ascertain the current state, we assess the h(x) function along with its corresponding Jacobian matrix, H. The Kalman gain is subsequently determined and used to update both the state itself and its associated covariance.






Step 2: Track Management

We now turn our attention to the field of track management, where the tracklist is equipped to manage multiple objects simultaneously. In our device architecture, we represent each object as a track. To ensure these tracks remain up-to-date, we transfer both track information and measurement data to the Kalman filter, which is responsible for managing the specific task associated with each track.
Initially, the track is initialized with lidar calculations that have not yet been assigned.
When the track's scores are in alignment with the measurements, the corresponding scores are increased, and vice versa. We employ a track ranking system to adjust the track's conditions.
If a track's score drops below a specific three-point threshold and the state balance surpasses a certain level, the track is retained for further consideration and is not eliminated.





Step 3: Data Association

In this phase, the nearest neighbor association process effectively matches multiple measurements with multiple tracks. Within the association.py file, the concept of data association is introduced, and the procedure proceeds as outlined below.
We generate a matrix that encompasses all tracks and available observations.
We calculate the Mahalanobis Distance for each measurement in relation to each track.
A Chi-Square hypothesis test is employed to filter out unlikely track-measurement pairs.
The pair with the smallest Mahalanobis Distance is chosen and utilized to update the Kalman Filter. Subsequently, the corresponding row and column in the relationship matrix are eliminated.









Step 4: Sensor Fusion

We will now introduce an enhancement to the Kalman filter. The fundamental assumption in this context is that the center of a car's 3D space bounding box corresponds to the center of the vehicle's 2D imagery. While this assumption is generally valid, it may not always hold true, especially for a front-facing camera. The implementation incorporates a projection matrix that converts points from 3D space into 2D image coordinates. We utilize partial derivatives (x, y, z) to map these points to model parameters (u, v) while also considering noise (R). If the tracking status is within the Field of View (FOV), we accept the measurement-track pair; otherwise, it is rejected.





• Difficulties Faced in Project:
There were some difficulties faced during the project such as project files and some parameters were hard to find from the library packages. I had to reverse engineer some parts of the code given to understand the implementation. Also, the workspace on the virtual machine keeps losing the connections which becomes a huge issue for project running. Nevertheless, I would say that some of the algorithms such as EKF, Data Association and Track Management were easy to implement because of the exercises and solutions provided in the course lectures.

• Benefits in Camera-Lidar Fusion tracking over Lidar-only tracking:
The debate for this is still present in the automotive industry leaders, but I personally found that it is a stable and reliable tracking. I think it would be even better if we could add one more sensor other than a camera and a lidar to fuse and eventually gain more confidence in object detection and tracking. LiDAR does a tremendous job in the multi-dimensional projections and tracking the objects. Different deep neural network algorithms such as YOLO, ResNet and DarkNet and their evolved versions can provide enhanced benefit in using Camera-Lidar fusion tracking methods.

• Real-life challenges:
The only real-life challenge that I can think of is, the ambiguity in the decision making from the data in camera and lidar. This can either lead to less confident decision in object tracking or create a false negative detection and eventually a degraded performance. Also, LiDAR has a chance of detection ghost objects more than the camera.
